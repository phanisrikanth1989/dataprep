# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-14)

**Core value:** Any Talend job using the target components must produce identical results when run through the Python engine
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Infrastructure Bug Fixes & Project Setup

## Current Position

Phase: 5 of 12 (tmap component)
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-04-14

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Java bridge must be reliable BEFORE component work -- moved to Phase 2 so tMap, code components, and routines can depend on it
- Config mutation in BaseComponent blocks iterate -- must fix in Phase 1 (ENG-09, ENG-21) before Phase 10
- OnSubjobOk trigger timing fix (ENG-10) is prerequisite for execution loop restructure in Phase 3
- Transform components split: Group A (complex bugs) in Phase 6, Group B (lighter/Green) in Phase 7
- 30% of jobs need iterate support -- Phase 10 is high priority after execution loop

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns
