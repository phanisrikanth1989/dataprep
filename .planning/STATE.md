# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-14)

**Core value:** Any Talend job using the target components must produce identical results when run through the Python engine
**Current focus:** Phase 07.1 — manager-audit-and-basecomponent-fixes

## Current Position

Phase: 09
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-04-25

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Java bridge must be reliable BEFORE component work -- moved to Phase 2 so tMap, code components, and routines can depend on it
- Config mutation in BaseComponent blocks iterate -- must fix in Phase 1 (ENG-09, ENG-21) before Phase 10
- OnSubjobOk trigger timing fix (ENG-10) is prerequisite for execution loop restructure in Phase 3
- Transform components split: Group A (complex bugs) in Phase 6, Group B (lighter/Green) in Phase 7
- 30% of jobs need iterate support -- Phase 10 is high priority after execution loop

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 05.1 inserted after Phase 5: Java Bridge tMap Fix (URGENT) -- Phase 2 rewrite broke RowWrapper Arrow type conversion and compiled tMap script execution. Must fix before Phase 6+.
- Phase 07.1 inserted after Phase 7: Manager Audit & BaseComponent Fixes (URGENT) -- Manager-commit audit (range 52dbada..f0f6351, 19 commits, 28 files) surfaced 48 in-scope regressions and gaps including BaseComponent crashes (CR-01, CR-02), Phase 4 file I/O regressions (CR-03, CR-06, CR-09), Phase 6 AggregateRow Talend-parity violations (CR-05), broken Java build on Mac/Linux (CR-04 pom.xml), and a not-production-ready new Normalize component. API findings (27) skipped per direction. See .planning/review/TRIAGE.md for the full triage matrix and .planning/review/manager-commits-REVIEW*.md for evidence. Must complete before Phase 8.
